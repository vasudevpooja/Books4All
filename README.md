This app was made using Android Studio (using Java as the programming language) and Firebase Authentication which provides backend services, easy-to-use SDKs, and inbuilt UI libraries to authenticate users to our app. It also enables us to use custom claims which weâ€™ve leveraged to build a flexible role-based API.   
But the main idea of the app is that to help elderly people enjoy their love of reading without having to strain their eyes. We've used text to speech technology which allows the users to understand the information in a way that makes content easier to retain and provides an option for content consumption on the go, taking content away from the screen and into an environment that's convenient for the consumer.
